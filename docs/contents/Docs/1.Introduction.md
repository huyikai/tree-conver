## arrayToTree

This method converts a flat node array into a tree structure.

The implementation of this method is to first convert the given node array into a mapping with the node ID as the key, and then traverse each node, find its parent node, and add it to the parent node's children property. Finally, the entire tree is constructed starting from the root node and the tree structure data is returned.

### Parameters

It accepts two parameters:

- **Array**: Flat node array

- **Options**: An optional parameter object that is used to configure the specific behavior of the conversion method

  | Parameter   | Description                                  | Type   | Default Value |
  | ----------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------- |
  | childrenKey | Custom node children field name              | string | 'children'    |
  | idKey       | Custom node ID field name                    | string | 'id'          |
  | pidKey      | Custom node parent ID field name             | string | 'pid'         |

### Return Value

Returns a tree-structured node array.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**

  The time complexity of this method is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. In the method, the input array is traversed and a mapping from node ID to node is created, which takes O(n) time. Next, all nodes are traversed again, and they are added to the children array of their parent nodes, which also takes O(n) time. Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n).

- **Space Complexity**

  The space complexity of this method is O(n), where n is the length of the array. In the method, a mapping from node ID to node is created by traversing the array, and all nodes are stored in the mapping, so the space complexity is O(n). Then, all child nodes are added to the parentNode's children property by traversing all nodes in the mapping, which is also O(n) space complexity. Therefore, the space complexity of the arrayToTree method is O(n).

## treeToArray

This method converts tree-structured data into a flattened array.

The specific implementation of this method is based on the breadth-first traversal of the binary tree. For each node traversed, a series of processing is performed, such as storing all properties of the node in a new node object, deleting ignored properties, and calculating and adding properties that need to be added. After these processing, the node will be saved in a new form to an array, and finally all node information (including descendant nodes) contained in the array will be returned.

### Parameters

It accepts two parameters:

- **Tree**: Tree structure containing all nodes

- **Options**: An optional parameter object that is used to configure the specific behavior of the conversion method

  | Property     | Description                                                  | Type                                            | Default Value |
  | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
  | addFields    | A list of field names and their corresponding attribute value calculation methods that need to be added | [{ fieldName: string;callback: (item) => any }] | []            |
  | childrenKey  | Key name of child node                                       | string                                          | 'children'    |
  | ignoreFields | List of field names to be ignored                            | string[]                                        | []            |
  | needParentId | Whether to add the ID of the parent node of the node information | boolean                                         | true          |

### Return Value

Returns an array containing all node information, including their own information and the information of their descendant nodes.

### Complexity

- Time Complexity

  The time complexity of this method depends on the depth and number of nodes in the tree. In the worst case, if the tree is a balanced tree and each node has multiple child nodes, the time complexity is O(nlogn). In the case of a small tree height, even if each node has multiple child nodes, the time complexity is still O(n), where n is the number of nodes. The method uses a stack to implement iteration to reduce memory usage and nested call stacks. Therefore, the method can be efficiently implemented in most cases.

- Space Complexity

  The space complexity of this method is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Because the implementation of the method does not use recursion, but uses iteration, and uses a stack to implement depth-first traversal. The maximum length of the node array stored in the stack is the depth of the tree, so the space complexity is O(n).
